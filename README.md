# StudentWellnessTracker
The Student Wellness Tracker is a React-based app that lets students log their mood, eating habits, homework hours, GPA, and extracurricular involvement daily. It analyzes these inputs to detect patterns, predict potential burnout, and forecast changes in mood and academic performance, helping students manage their well-being effectively.
